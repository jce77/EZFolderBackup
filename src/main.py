EZ Folder Backup v1.1.2

Update v1.1.2
- Added a custom trashing function that is only used if send2trash is not installed, so the program still works on
fresh Ubuntu Linux with zero extra modules.

A simple local backup application that runs on Windows and Linux

Run on windows:
    Run 'EZ Folder Backup.exe'
Run on linux with graphics:
    Run the script with no parameters:
    $ python main.py
Run on linux with command line only:
    See all parameters by running:
        $ python main.py -help
    Basic backup command is:
        $ python main.py -runbackup -m /path_to_main/ -b /path_to_backup/
